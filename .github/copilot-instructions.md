# Copilot usage instructions

- Do NOT run build or test commands unless explicitly asked to do so.
  - If you need a build or tests run, wait for a direct command like "run build" or "run tests".

- Do NOT generate an automatic summary of what you have done after every chat.
  - Provide summaries only when specifically requested.

These instructions are project-level preferences to avoid unexpected side effects during development.
